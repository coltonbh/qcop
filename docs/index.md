## Installation

```sh
python -m pip install qcop
```

## Quickstart

`qcop` uses the `qcio` data structures to drive quantum chemistry programs in a standardized way. This allows for a simple and consistent interface to a wide variety of quantum chemistry programs. See the [qcio](https://github.com/coltonbh/qcio) library for documentation on the input and output data structures.

The `compute` function is the main entry point for the library and is used to run a calculation.

```python
from qcio import Structure, CalcSpec
from qcop import compute
from qcop.exceptions import ExternalProgramError
# Create the Structure
h2o = Structure.open("h2o.xyz")

# Define the calcspec
spec = CalcSpec(
    structure=h2o,
    calctype="energy",
    model={"method": "hf", "basis": "sto-3g"},
    keywords={"purify": "no", "restricted": False},
)

# Run the calculation; will return Results or raise an exception
try:
    result = compute("terachem", spec, collect_files=True)
except ExternalProgramError as e:
    # External QQ program failed in some way
    result = e.results
    result.input_data # Input data used by the QC program
    result.success # Will be False
    result.data # Any half-computed results before the failure
    result.traceback # Stack trace from the calculation
    result.logs # Logs from the calculation
    result.ptraceback # Shortcut to print out the traceback in human readable format
    raise e
else:
    # Calculation succeeded
    result.input_data # Input data used by the QC program
    result.success # Will be True
    result.data # All structured data and files from the calculation
    result.data.files # Any files returned by the calculation
    result.logs # Logs from the calculation
    result.plogs # Shortcut to print out the logs in human readable format
    result.provenance # Provenance information about the calculation
    result.extras # Any extra information not in the schema

```

One may also call `compute(..., raise_exc=False)` to return a `Results` object rather than raising an exception when a calculation fails. This may allow easier handling of failures in some cases.

```python
from qcio import Structure, CalcSpec
from qcop import compute
from qcop.exceptions import ExternalProgramError
# Create the Structure
h2o = Structure.open("h2o.xyz")

# Define the calcspec
spec = CalcSpec(
    structure=h2o,
    calctype="energy",
    model={"method": "hf", "basis": "sto-3g"},
    keywords={"purify": "no", "restricted": False},
)

# Run the calculation; will return a Results object
result = compute("terachem", spec, collect_files=True, raise_exc=False)
if not result.success:
    # Same as except block above

else:
    # Same as else block above

```

Alternatively, the `compute_args` function can be used to run a calculation with the input data structures passed in as arguments rather than as a single `CalcSpec` object.

```python
from qcio import Structure
from qcop import compute_args
# Create the Structure
h2o = Structure.open("h2o.xyz")

# Run the calculation
result = compute_args(
    "terachem",
    h2o,
    calctype="energy",
    model={"method": "hf", "basis": "sto-3g"},
    keywords={"purify": "no", "restricted": False},
    files={...},
    collect_files=True
)
```

The behavior of `compute()` and `compute_args()` can be tuned by passing in keyword arguments like `collect_files` shown above. Arguments can modify which scratch directory location to use, whether to delete or keep the scratch files after a calculation completes, what files to collect from a calculation, whether to stream the program logs in real time as the program executes, and whether to propagate a wavefunction through a series of calculations. Arguments also include hooks for passing in update functions that can be called as a program executes in real time. See the [compute method docstring](https://github.com/coltonbh/qcop/blob/83868df51d241ffae3497981dfc3c72235319c6e/qcop/adapters/base.py#L57-L123) for more details.

See the [/examples](https://github.com/coltonbh/qcop/tree/master/examples) directory for more examples.

## ✨ Visualization ✨

Visualize all your results with a single line of code!

First install the visualization module:

```sh
python -m pip install qcio[view]
```

or if your shell requires `''` around arguments with brackets:

```sh
python -m pip install 'qcio[view]'
```

Then in a Jupyter notebook import the `qcio` view module and call `view.view(...)` passing it one or any number of `qcio` objects you want to visualizing including `Structure` objects or any `Results` object. You may also pass an array of `titles` and/or `subtitles` to add additional information to the molecular structure display. If no titles are passed `qcio` with look for `Structure` identifiers such as a name or SMILES to label the `Structure`.

![Structure Viewer](https://public.coltonhicks.com/assets/qcio/structure_viewer.png)

Seamless visualizations for `Results` objects make results analysis easy!

![Optimization Viewer](./docs/assets/optimization_viewer.png)

Single point calculations display their results in a table.

![Single Point Viewer](./docs/assets/single_point_viewer.png)

If you want to use the HTML generated by the viewer to build your own dashboards use the functions inside of `qcio.view.py` that begin with the word `generate_` to create HTML you can insert into any dashboard.
